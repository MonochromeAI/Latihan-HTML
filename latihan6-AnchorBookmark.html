    <p>ずっと眺めていた 遠く幼い頃から
        今も色褪せたその景色は
        真白な壁に飾ってある
        かわいた風をからませ
        あなたを連れてくのさ
        Honey so sweet 限りない夢を
        この両手につかんで fu
        転がってゆく道で 少しイカレタだけさ
        深い痛みはとれないけど
        そんな哀しい目をしないで
        かわいた風をからませ
        あなたを連れてくのさ
        Honey so sweet 信じてほしい
        この世界が嘘でも
        I want to fly, waitin' for sunrise

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walkin' around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby, "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia, ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisi' (hey, hey)Sun is down, freezin' cold
